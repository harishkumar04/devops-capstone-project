As a DevOps Engineer
I need an automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying applications
So that software can be built, tested, and deployed quickly, reliably, and consistently
Details and Assumptions
The pipeline should support continuous integration (code builds, automated testing) and continuous deployment (deployment to staging/production).
Source code will be managed in a Git-based repository (e.g., GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).
Builds should be containerized using Docker for portability.
Deployments will target a Kubernetes cluster (or another container orchestration system).
Monitoring and logging will be enabled (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack).
Pipeline should support rollback in case of deployment failures.
Security scanning (dependencies, container images) should be included.
Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Format)
Feature: CI/CD Pipeline Automation

  Scenario: Automated build on code commit
    Given a developer pushes new code to the main branch
    When the CI/CD pipeline runs
    Then the code should be built successfully
    And unit/integration tests should execute automatically
    And a container image should be generated and pushed to the registry

  Scenario: Deployment to staging environment
    Given a successful build and test
    When the pipeline deploys to the staging environment
    Then the application should be accessible at the staging URL
    And monitoring should display application health metrics

  Scenario: Deployment to production with rollback
    Given a successful deployment to staging
    When the pipeline promotes the build to production
    Then the production environment should run the new version
    And if deployment fails
    Then the pipeline should rollback to the last stable version

  Scenario: Security scanning
    Given a new container image is built
    When the pipeline runs security checks
    Then any vulnerabilities should be reported
    And builds with critical vulnerabilities should fail

  Scenario: Observability
    Given the application is deployed
    When the system is running
    Then logs should be collected centrally
    And metrics should be available on a monitoring dashboard
